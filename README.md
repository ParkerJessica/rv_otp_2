# Groxio OTP and Elixir Training

Groxio training

## 1 Install these tools, plus Elixir

The tools you will need to install: 

- zoom 
- git (https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- livebook (https://livebook.dev/#install)
- an editor that you are comfortable with. 

You will also need a camera that works with Zoom. We will keep our cameras on throughout the class to improve communication and engagement. 

For the development dependencies, you'll need: 

- Elixir 1.15, with OTP 26. Make sure it's working: 
run the command: 

```
[rv_otp_2] âž” elixir -v
Erlang/OTP 26 [erts-14.2.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:10:10] [ds:10:10:10] [async-threads:1] [jit]

Elixir 1.15.4 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 26)
```

Verify that observer is working (helpful but optional):

```
[rv_otp_2] -> iex
iex(1)> :observer.start
```

You will see a window come up and the `:ok` return code. Now for Livebook: 

```
[rv_otp_2] -> livebook server
[Livebook] Application running at http://localhost:8080/?token=???
```

The token will be different on your machine. Don't save this for the last minute! It's a hands on class, and you need time to work out any bugs you might encounter. 

## 2. Clone this repository

1. Fork this repository to your github account. 

- Go to https://github.com/groxio-learning/rv_otp_2
- Click the `fork` button in the upper right corner
- Navigate to *your local version* (at something like git@github.com:your-github-user/rv_otp_2.git. )
- Copy the clone address to your clipboard. Click the bright green `code` button, then click the copy-to-clipboard button on the `clone` page.

2. Clone your local version to your local machine. 

- Clone it. *REPLACE your-github-account with your github account name*:  

```
>  git clone <paste the url>
...clones repo...
cd rv_otp_2
```

- Verify your remote: 

```
$ git remote -v
> origin  https://github.com/your-user/rv_otp_2.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/your-user/rv_otp_2.git (push)
```

- If there's no origin, set it. Make sure you *replace your-github-user*:

```
rv_otp_2> git remote add origin https://github.com/your-github-user/rv_otp_2.git
```

- Verify your remote: 

```
$ git remote -v
> origin  https://github.com/your-user/rv_otp_2.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/your-user/rv_otp_2.git (push)
```

- Set the upstream to the Groxio repo:

```
rv_otp_2> git remote add upstream https://github.com/groxio-learning/rv_otp_2.git
```

- Verify the remotes: 

```
> origin  https://github.com/your-user/rv_otp_2.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/your-user/rv_otp_2.git (push)
> upstream  https://github.com/groxio-learning/rv_otp_2.git (fetch)
> upstream  https://github.com/groxio-learning/rv_otp_2.git (push)
```
